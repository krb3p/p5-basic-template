# Basic p5.js

## Setup

A p5.js project is pretty simple. There are two main parts: an HTML page, and a JavaScript file. This template has both. You'll code all your p5.js in the file named draw.js, which has already been linked to the index.html page. You'll preview the index.html page to see the effects of what you draw using p5.
